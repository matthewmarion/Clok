## Features
Freelancers should be able to easily add `clients, projects and tasks` to create a visual workflow for themselves and the client.

#### Clients
How to organize your freelance work. This is who you are working for. A client is **REQUIRED**. If you are tracking time for yourself and not a real client, make the client yourself.

    - Root of the organization structure
    - An individual or a company
    - Assign pay rates (optional)

#### Project
Projects should be used whenever a client is hiring you out for more than one assignment. A project is not needed in a scenario when you are doing one thing for a client then moving on. 

    - Created under a client (optional)
    - Assign pay rates -- overrides client pay rate

#### Tasks
A task is used every time you want to start tracking your session. Tasks are organized under projects.

    - Created under projects.
    - Click start button to start tracking then
    - Stop button to stop tracking a started session
    - A task can be created/edited by typing in the time intervals manually
    - Assign pay rates -- overrides project && client pay rate
